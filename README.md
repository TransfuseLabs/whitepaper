## Transfuse Technical Architecture and Whitepaper V0.0.1

### Introduction

#### High-Level Overview

**Transfuse** is a transformative multichain asset bridge designed to enable secure, fast, and scalable asset transfers between Ethereum and Stellar networks **without using wrapped assets**. This Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on implementing smart contracts on both Ethereum and Stellar (Soroban) to handle end-to-end (E2E) interactions for native USDC swaps.

The bridge leverages Stellar's fast, secure, and low-cost transactions to provide a seamless user experience while addressing inherent risks associated with cross-chain bridges.

### Contract Overview

#### Ethereum Smart Contract

**Purpose**:

- Securely lock USDC tokens when a swap is initiated.
- Emit events for validators to detect and process swaps.

**Key Methods**:

- `initiateSwap(uint256 amount, address stellarAddress)`: Locks USDC and records the recipient's Stellar address.
- `getSwapDetails(uint256 swapId)`: Retrieves details of a specific swap.
- `cancelSwap(uint256 swapId)`: Allows users to cancel pending swaps (if applicable).

**Security Considerations**:

- **Input Validation**: Ensure valid amounts and addresses.
- **Event Emission**: Emit `SwapInitiated` event with swap details.
- **Reentrancy Guard**: Protect against reentrancy attacks.

---

#### Stellar (Soroban) Smart Contract

**Purpose**:

- Release USDC tokens to the user on Stellar upon validation.
- Ensure that swaps are only completed after proper verification.

**Key Methods**:

- `releaseTokens(uint256 amount, Address ethereumAddress)`: Releases USDC to the user's Stellar address.
- `verifySwap(uint256 swapId, uint256 amount, Address ethereumAddress)`: Validates the swap before releasing funds.

**Security Considerations**:

- **Authorization**: Only allow actions from trusted validator nodes.
- **Atomicity**: Ensure that token release is atomic and cannot be interrupted.
- **Event Logging**: Emit events for swap completions.
